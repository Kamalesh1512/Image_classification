# Image Classification Project: Plant Seedling Classification
## Overview:
Successfully tackled the Plant Seedling Classification problem by employing advanced techniques in image classification. Leveraged a dataset comprising 5.5k images across 12 distinct categories.

## Model Architecture:
Utilized the VGG16 architecture pretrained on ImageNet weights for feature extraction. Implemented Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation functions and Softmax for the output layer. Employed Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer with a specified learning rate. The loss function was set to Categorical Crossentropy, and model evaluation metrics included accuracy.

## Model Evaluation:
Conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the model, revealing notable performance metrics:
Training duration: 8 seconds per epoch
Average time per step: 452 milliseconds
Final Model Accuracy: 88.24%
This project not only demonstrated my proficiency in leveraging state-of-the-art models for image classification but also showcased my ability to optimize and evaluate models effectively.
